Login System and Number Guessing Game
Introduction
This C++ program is a combination of a basic Login System and a Number Guessing Game. Users can register an account, log in using their credentials, recover forgotten passwords, and after successful login, they can play a number guessing game. The number guessing game involves betting chips and guessing a random number generated by the program.

Features:

1. Home Page
The user is first presented with a home page where they can:
Press 7 to enter the login system.
Press 3 to exit the program.

3. Login System
After pressing 7, users are directed to the login page with the following options:
Login: Users can log in if they have registered before.
Registration: New users can create an account by entering a username and password.
Forgot Password: Users can recover their password if they forget it.
Exit: Allows the user to exit the program.

5. Game Introduction
After successful login, users can choose to play a Number Guessing Game or return to the main menu.

7. Number Guessing Game
If users are 18 or older, they are allowed to play the game.
Users start with 100 chips.
They can place a bet and guess a number (1 or 2). If they guess correctly, they win 10x the bet amount.
If they lose all chips, the game ends and they are redirected to the main menu.

Files Used
record.txt:
This file is used to store the usernames and passwords for user login. When a user registers, their credentials are appended to this file. It is also used to verify login credentials and to recover forgotten passwords.

How It Works
Home Page
The home page gives the user the option to start the login system or exit the program.
Based on the input, the program either continues to the login system or exits.

Login
Users enter their username and password.
If the entered credentials match any record in record.txt, login is successful.
If login fails, the user is redirected back to the main menu.

Registration
Users are prompted to enter a new username and password.
These credentials are stored in record.txt.
After successful registration, users are redirected back to the main menu.

Forgot Password
If a user forgets their password, they can enter their username to recover it.
If the username exists, the corresponding password is displayed.
If not, the user is informed that the account was not found.

Number Guessing Game
Users are first asked their age to check if they are eligible to play.
After reading and accepting the rules, users start with 100 chips.

For each round:
Users place a bet.
The program generates a random number between 1 and 2.
Users guess the number.
If correct, they win 10x their bet. If incorrect, they lose the bet amount.
The game continues until the user runs out of chips or decides to quit.


How to Run
Compile and run the C++ program.
The user will first see the home page where they can start the login system or exit the program.
Once logged in, users can play the number guessing game or return to the main menu.


Improvements and Future Work

User Interface: Improve the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
Multiplayer: Add support for multiple users playing the game at the same time.
More Games: Extend the system to include more games or activities after login.


Conclusion
This project showcases a simple implementation of a login system with file handling and integrates it with a fun number guessing game. It serves as a great starting point for learning file management, conditional statements, and basic game mechanics in C++.
